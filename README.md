## D.A.V.I.Dash: Decentralized Application for Visualizing Information
Hackathon project for MakeItMobile

## Problem statement: 
There are no good celo visualization dApps/dashboards that help users understand:
* Where you are spending cUSD & Celo
* Where you are receiving cUSD & Celo
* What apps you are interacting with & the associated yields 
* Moola Market - (total x APY)
* UbeSwap - Liquidity pool yield
* How much you are sending to ImpactMarket

### How does this fit into the Celo ecosystem/core tenants:  

_“Design for all” - everyone should have access to their financial data_

TL:DR - We think it would be really cool to build data tools to help everyday people, traders and refugees improve financial stability through financial insights such as where your money is coming from, how you’re spending it and what applications are helping you save for the future!
